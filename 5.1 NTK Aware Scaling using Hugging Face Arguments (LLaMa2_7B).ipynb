    "1 INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models (LLMs) typically come with a pre-defined context window size. For exam-\n",
    "ple, inputs to LLaMA models (Touvron et al., 2023) must be fewer than 2048 tokens. This pre-set\n",
    "context window limit is frequently exceeded in applications such as conducting long conversations,\n",
    "summarizing long documents, or executing long-term planning. For these applications, LLMs with\n",
    "longer context windows are preferred. However, training an LLM from scratch with long context\n",
    "windows requires significant investments. This naturally leads to a question: Can we extend the\n",
    "context window of an existing pre-trained LLM?\n",
    "\n",
    "One straightforward approach is to fine-tune an existing pre-trained Transformer with a longer con-\n",
    "text window. However, empirically, we found that models trained this way adapt to long context\n",
    "windows very slowly. After training for more than 10000 batches, the effective context window\n",
    "saw a minimal increase, moving from 2048 to 2560 (Table 4). This suggests that such method is\n",
    "inefficient for extending to substantially longer context windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "While certain techniques such as ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) and LeX (Sun et al., 2022) enable length\n",
    "extrapolation of Transformers, i.e. train on short context windows and inference on longer ones,\n",
    "many existing pre-trained LLMs, including LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), use positional encodings\n",
    "that have weak extrapolation properties (e.g., RoPE (Su et al., 2021)). Therefore, the applicability\n",
    "of these techniques for extending the context window sizes of such LLMs remains limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, we introduce Position Interpolation to enable context window extensions for certain\n",
    "existing pre-trained LLMs, including LLaMA. The key idea is, instead of extrapolation, we directly\n",
    "down-scale the position indices so that the maximum position index matches the previous context\n",
    "window limit in the pre-training stage. See Figure 1 for an illustration. In other words, to accom-\n",
    "modate more input tokens, we interpolate the position encodings at neighboring integer positions,\n",
    "utilizing the fact that position encodings can be applied on non-integer positions, as opposed to\n",
    "extrapolating outside the trained positions, which may lead to catastrophic values. We verify our\n",
    "approach theoretically, by showing that the interpolated attention score has a much smaller upper\n",
    "\n",
    "bound (~ 600x smaller in LLaMA 7B setting) than the extrapolated one, and is thus much more\n",
    "stable. Therefore, interpolated position encodings are easier for the model to adapt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirically, we found that Position Interpolation is highly effective and efficient, requiring only a\n",
    "very short period of fine-tuning for the model to fully adapt to greatly extended context windows.\n",
    "We present experimental results for extending the context window to up to 32768 from the initial\n",
    "2048 across 7B to 65B LLaMA models using Position Interpolation. Our results show that\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Position Interpolation can easily enable very long context windows (e.g. 32768), requiring\n",
    "only fine-tuning for 1000 steps on the Pile (Gao et al., 2020) to achieve a good quality.\n",
    "The cost of fine-tuning is negligible compared to the pre-training costs. This confirms\n",
    "our hypothesis that it is relatively easy for the models to adapt to interpolated position\n",
    "encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Position Interpolation generates strong models that can effectively make use of much ex-\n",
    "tended context window. We show that models extended by Position Interpolation enjoy\n",
    "significant perplexity gains from greatly extended context windows for text modeling, and\n",
    "we show that the perplexity reduces graceful with the enlargement of context windows.\n",
    "We also applied Position Interpolation in a long text summarization task, and demonstrate\n",
    "competitive performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Position Interpolation preserves model quality relatively well for tasks within its original\n",
    "context window sizes. We present a variety of evaluation results for the extended LLaMA\n",
    "models on the original LLaMA benchmark. Compared with original LLaMA models, the\n",
    "extended LLLaM A models saw a minor degradation on several standard benchmarks within\n",
    "a 2048 token limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our results highlight the innate ability of Transformer models to “extrapolate to sequence lengths\n",
    "longer than the ones encountered during training” as hypothesized in the seminal work of Vaswani\n",
    "et al. (2017). We reaffirm this hypothesis and suggest that the previously known weakness of ex-\n",
    "trapolating to longer sequences for language modeling (Press et al., 2022) may be due to direct\n",
    "\n",
    "extrapolation of positional encodings and it can be largely mitigated by interpolating position en-\n",
    "codings instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrent work. Right before our release, we are informed with a concurrent blogpost (Super-\n",
    "HOT kaiokendev (2023)) that also interpolates positional encoding in RoPE to extend the context\n",
    "window from 2K to 8K. Recently, open source community picks it up in Reddit post ! and Github\n",
    "Issues 2, which shows that fine-tuning with LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) also seems to work well. Our\n",

    "extrapolated ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 METHOD\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 BACKGROUND: ROTARY POSITION EMBEDDING (ROPE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer models require explicit positional information to be injected, typically in the form of\n",
    "positional encodings, to represent the order of inputs. We consider Rotary Position Embedding\n",
    "(ROPE) (Su et al., 2021), which is the position encoding used in the LLLaMA model (Touvron et al.,\n",
    "2023). Given a position index m € [0, ¢) and an embedding vector x := [zg, 71,..., 241], Where\n",
    "d is the dimension of the attention head, RoPE defines a vector-valued complex function f{x, m) as\n",
    "follows\n",
    "\n",
    "Using RoPE, the self-attention score\n",
    "is only dependent on relative position m — 7 through trigonometric functions. Here q and k are the\n",
    "query and key vector for a specific attention head. At each layer, RoPE is applied on both query and\n",
    "key embeddings for computing attention scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 DIRECT EXTRAPOLATION\n",
    "\n",
    "While the attention score in RoPE only depends on the relative positions, which is what we want,\n",
    "its extrapolation performance is not great . In particular, when directly extending to larger context\n",
    "windows unseen in the training, the perplexity may shoot up to very high numbers (i.e., > 10%),\n",
    "comparable to untrained models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we want to see the model trained on a context window of size L = 2048 to still work\n",
    "reasonably well on longer context window, but may not have the capability to leverage information\n",
    "that appears beyond L. For example, to answer a question located at 3000, the model trained on\n",
    "maximal window size of I = 2048 cannot leverage evidences provided at location 0, but still\n",
    "can leverage the evidences provided at location 2900. In contrast, in reality we see catastrophic\n",
    "behaviors, i.e., question at location 3000 cannot be answered correctly, even if the evidences are\n",
    "located at location 2900.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the reason behind? How could this happen if the attention score a,,,—,, decays as the relative\n",
    "distance |m — n/| increases, according to Section 3.4.3 of (Su et al., 2021), and content from very\n",
    "far distances should not matter that much? It turns out that the upper bound derived in Section 3.4.3\n",
    "of (Su et al., 2021) may be too loose: while it indeed decays with respect to |m — nl, the bound\n",
    "can still be quite large (i.e., the bound can be critically depends on the magnitude of v;) and thus\n",
    "vacuous. In fact, if we treat all trigonometric functions as basis functions (i.e, ¢;(s) := #93), and\n",
    "think about Eqn. 2 as basis expansion as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "where s is the positional span between a query and a key and h; := (ga; + igaj+1){k2j — tk2j+1)\n",
    "are complex coefficients depending on q and k (here the definition of h; is exactly the same as the\n",
    "definition of k; in Sec 3.4.3 in RoPE (Su et al., 2021)). Now the the issue becomes clear: as shown\n",
    "in Fig. 2, a, can be small in magnitude in the range of [0, 2048], but gives huge values out of the\n",
    "region. The underlying reason is that the trigonometric family {¢;} (with sufficiently large d) is\n",
    "a universal approximator and can fit any arbitrary functions. Therefore, for a, there always exist\n",
    "coefficients {h;} (i.e. key and query) that corresponds to small function values in [0, 2048] but\n",
    "\n",
    "much larger in regions beyond.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3 PROPOSED APPROACH: POSITION INTERPOLATION (PI)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Fig. 2, thanks to the smoothness of bases functions ¢; interpolation is much more stable and will\n",
    "not lead to wild values. Therefore, instead of extrapolate the attention score in Eqn. 3 to s > L,\n",
    "how about we define an attention score a{s) = a(Ls/L’) where L’ is the longer context window?\n",
    "Formally, we replace RoPE f by {’ defined as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "We call this transformation on the position encoding Position Interpolation. In this step, we reduce\n",
    "position indices from [0, L') to [0, L) to match the original range of indices before computing RoPE.\n",
    "Consequently, as inputs to RoPE, the maximum relative distance between any two tokens has been\n",
    "reduced from I’ to L. Since we align the ranges of position indices and relative distances before\n",
    "and after extension, we mitigate the effect on attention score computation due to context window\n",
    "extensions, which can allow the model easier to adapt. To further demonstrate this is the case, in the\n",
    "following theorem, we show that the interpolated attention score is well-behaved:\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is no close form for B(s) := 4/21 |Ag41(s)|, numerically it is at least larger than d, and for many positional difference s, B(s) is much larger than d\n",
    "(check Appendix B for the plot). Therefore, the interpolation bound is at least 2 - 294.73 ~ 600 x\n",
    "smaller than the extrapolation bound, and thus the interpolated attention score is much more stable\n",
    "than extrapolated one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, our method of rescaling of position indices does not introduce extra weight, or modify\n",
    "the model architecture in any way. This makes it attractive in practical applications, since most\n",
    "infrastructure and optimization for the original model can be reused after the extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning. We can further fine-tune the interpolated model using the next token prediction task\n",
    "with interpolated position encodings on the extended context window size using a pre-training cor-\n",
    "pus such as the Pile (Gao et al., 2020). In the next section, we show that our fine-tuning process\n",
    "only needs tens to hundreds thousands of examples. We also find that the result of the fine-tuning\n",
    "is not sensitive to the choice of examples. The reason may be that the model is only adapting to the\n",
    "new context window during the fine-tuning phase, starting from a good initialization, as opposed to\n",
    "acquiring new knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other ways to reduce interpolation/extrapolation bound. From the expression of the interpola-\n",
    "tion (Eqn. 5) and extrapolation bound (Eqn. 8), a common term is max; ||, which is the maximal\n",
    "magnitude of query/key products. If we enforce a regularization on || during LLM training, it is\n",
    "possible that the catastrophic extrapolation error can be mitigated or even resolved. In fact, if we\n",
    "apply ridge regression with proper regularization to fit a curve in Fig. 2, the magnitude of extrapo-\n",
    "lated a(s) when s > L can be comparable to that within [0, L]. To our knowledge, we are not aware\n",
    "of existing LLM pre-training techniques that leverage this regularization and will leave it for future\n",
    "work.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 EXPERIMENTS\n",
    "\n",
    "We show Position Interpolation can effectively extend context window up to 32 times of the original\n",
    "size, and such extension can be done with only several hundreds of training steps. We show the\n",
    "resulting models are strong LLMs with fully effective long context windows. We demonstrate its\n",
    "performance in a number of tasks including language modeling, passkey retrieval, and long doc-\n",
    "ument summarization. We also present benchmark results of the extended models on the original\n",
    "LLaMA evaluation benchmarks.\n",
    "3.1 SETUP\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Variants. We extended the pre-trained 7B, 13B, 33B and 65B LLaMA models (Touvron\n",
    "et al., 2023) to various context window of sizes up to 32768, using either direct fine-tuning or\n",
    "Position Interpoloation method. Except for rescaling the position indices for models extended with\n",
    "Position Interpolation, we did not modify LLaMA model architectures (Touvron et al., 2023) in any\n",
    "ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Procedure. We fine-tune all model variants using the next token prediction objective. We\n",
    "use AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) with 5; = 0.9 and 2 = 0.95. We use a linear learning\n",
    "rate warmup of 20 steps starting from 10% of the maximum learning rate. For 7B and 13B models,\n",
    "we set the learning rate to 2 x 1075 and for 33B and 65B models we set the learning rate to 1072. We\n",
    "set the weight decay to zero. For extending 7B, 13B and 33B models to the 8192 context window\n",
    "size, we use 32 A100 GPUs and 64 global batch size. For all other cases we use 128 A100 GPUs and\n",
    "128 global batch size. We note that the main need of using more GPUs is memory limitation during\n",
    "fine-tuning, and it is possible to use fewer GPUs in certain cases. We train all models using PyTorch\n",
    "(Paszke et al., 2019) with Fully Sharded Data Parallel (Zhao et al., 2023) and Flash Attention (Dao\n",
    "et al., 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "If not specified otherwise, for the Position Interpolation method, we fine-tune the models for 1000\n",
    "steps. For the direct fine-tuning method, we use 10000 steps. We primarily fine-tune using the Pile\n",

    "\n",
    "We evaluate the long sequence language modeling performance of our extended models and base-\n",
    "lines on two datasets: book corpus (PG-19) (Rae et al., 2020) and cleaned Arxiv Math proof-pile\n",
    "dataset (Azerbayev et al., 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the test splits of PG19 (Rae et al., 2020) and proof-pile (Azerbayev et al., 2022). For PG19,\n",
    "we use the whole test split consisting of 100 documents. For the proof-pile dataset, we use a random\n",
    "subsample of 128 documents with at least 32768 SentencePiece (Kudo & Richardson, 2018) tokens\n",
    "and truncate to the first 32768 tokens for each test document. We evaluate perplexity at various\n",
    "context window size by using a sliding window approach following Press et al. (2022) with stride\n",
    "S = 256.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Table 1 and Table 2, we report the perplexity results for our models and baselines on the datasets.\n",
    "From the results, we found that models extended with our method enjoy a significantly improved\n",
    "perplexity from longer context window sizes. By increasing the context window size from 2048 to\n",
    "16384, we observed -0.28 and -0.5 reductions of perplexity for extending LLaMA 7B models on\n",

    "-0.3 reductions of perplexity by extending to the 8192 context window size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we observed a consistent trend of our models achieving better perplexity with longer\n",

    "to better predict next tokens in language modeling tasks. Moreover, we found this trend extends to\n",
    "32768 window size without diminishing on the PG19 dataset for LLaMA 7B and 13B models. This\n",
    "indicates that our method may enable extension to even longer context windows.\n",

    "from 0.01 to 0.05 across all models with extended with Position Interpolation. A small degradation\n",
    "of performance within original evaluation context window is expected since Position Interpolation\n",
    "forces position encodings in original context window to reside in a much narrower region, which\n",
    "may negatively affect the language model’s performance. We present more benchmark results on\n",
    "the original context window size in Section 3.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Table 3 we report the relationship between perplexity and the number of fine-tuning steps for\n",

    "3.3 MEASURING EFFECTIVE CONTEXT WINDOW SIZE THROUGH PASSKEY RETRIEVAL\n",
    "\n",
    "We study the effective context window size, i.e. the maximum distance of a token can effectively\n",

    "persistently fails to retrieve the correct passkey value across several independent attempts, it suggests\n",
    "that the effective context window size of the model is less than k. Conversely, if a model consistently\n",
    "succeeds in retrieving the correct passkey value, we deduce that the effective context window size\n",

      "The paper is about extending the context window of an existing pre-trained language model (LLaMA) via position interpolation, which can enable the model to adapt to longer context windows without significant investments in training. The authors introduce a new technique called position interpolation, which down-scales the position indices so that the maximum position index matches the previous context window limit in the pre-training stage, and demonstrates that this approach is more stable and effective in various experiments. They also show that the interpolated attention score is much smaller than the extrapolated one, which explains why the model can adapt to longer context windows with minimal fine-tuning. The paper highlights the innate ability of transformer models to \"extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training\" and suggests that the previously known weakness of extrapolating to longer sequences for language modeling may be due to direct extrapolation of positional encodings. The authors propose a new method that can mitigate this weakness and demonstrate its effectiveness in various experiments, including language modeling, passkey retrieval, and long document summarization tasks.\n",
